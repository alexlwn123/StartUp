This is just small project that I've whipped up...

StartUp.py is a Command Line application for launching websites. Think
of it as a Command Line bookmark bar. It includes a very basic gui and
various functionalities.

I plan to further develop this program to add more functionality such as
retrieving notification data from websites and displaying it in either
the command line or the gui.
