This is just small project that I've whipped up...

startup.py is a Command Line application for launching websites. Think of it as a Command Line bookmark bar. It includes a very basic gui and various functionalities.

I plan to further develop this program to add more functionality such as retrieving notification data from websites and displaying it in either the command line or the gui.
